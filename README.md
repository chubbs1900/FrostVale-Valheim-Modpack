## Updating the Server (Please email me if there is a better way, and I will Update)

0. Note: When you have your configs all set up for your server, it's nice to let R2Modman manage your config files, but these need to be backed up, BACK to your profile in R2ModMan.  This way you can just copy the directory over to your server's directory when updating and not overwriting your configs.  Also, all those generated configs will be available in R2ModMan for edit.
1. After updating in R2ModMan, go to settings and `Browse profile folder`.
2. This will open that folder in the background.  Copy all the files here and paste them into your server's folder to overwrite the updates files.
3. Mods like Seasonality are heavy in textures and same with Jewelcrafting.  So what I like to do is after pasting the files in, the pasted files in Windows will highlight.  So What I like to do is hit delete after pasting the files, then hitting paste again.  This will clean up any files that would normally linger from previous updates, like unused texture files in Seasonality.
4. Remember: this is all assuming you have backed your config files to the R2Modman's profile between any config updates.
